# divbloxjs

The divbloxjs library is the core of an expanding collection of integrated packages for nodejs backend development.

divbloxjs is a data-driven framework that comes prepackaged with an ORM, a wrapper for expressjs that is preconfigured with JWT support and several other useful features.

## Getting Started

`npx divbloxjs-create-app`

This will generate a new divbloxjs project with all prerequisites and the recommended project structure.

## How to build with divbloxjs

divbloxjs is meant to be used in a modular way, with a few core packages already implemented, many more to come, and a package-creator for the developer to implement any further functionality they may need.

Any specific functionality that the developer creates, will always reside inside of a package. Read more about [packages](https://github.com/divbloxjs/divbloxjs/wiki/2.-divbloxjs-Packages)
